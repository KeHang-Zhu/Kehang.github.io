"If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis that all things are made of atoms." - Richard Feynman

All the complex materials is made of atoms how the key ingredient for simulating these materials in computer is to get a way to describe these **atoms** and their **interactions**.

Think about it, all the hard-core course we learned from kindergarten to graduate school, the Newtonâ€™s rule, the electromagnetism and the quantum family buckets, they are all about clarifying the object and their interactions. Only for now and the level most people care about, the object is recognized as **atoms**.

Whether we wan to obtain an accurate description of chemical processes which chemists care most, the protein structure prediction which big pharm and biologist care most.
